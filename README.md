# Drug Category Classification

## Introduction

This projects aims to build two deep neural network models, namely CNN and Bi-LSTM, 
to classify drug categories from a set of online drug reviews using Tensorflow/Keras and [UCI Drug Review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018).

Our models are able to classify 14 different drug categories from drug reviews with an overall accuracy of approximately 89%
